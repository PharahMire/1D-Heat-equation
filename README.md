# 1D-Heat-equation using numerical scheme

The 1D Heat Equation has been solved using 4 numerical scheme :
-  DuFort-Frankel
-  Richardson (Central time, central space, explicit)
-  Laasonen Simple Implicit (Forward time, central space, implicit)
-  Crank-Nicholson (Trapezoidal)

The project needs to be compiled or imported into a C++ Visual Studio project
